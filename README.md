## Description

**SEO Content Gap Analyzer** is a powerful, privacy-focused WordPress plugin that helps site owners, bloggers, agencies, and SEO professionals discover content and keyword gaps compared to their competitors — all directly from the WordPress dashboard.

No external API keys required for core functionality (optional integrations available). It empowers you to:

- Compare your site's indexed keywords/topics against 1–5 competitors
- Spot "missing" and "weak" keywords your competitors rank for
- Visualize topic clusters to plan pillar/cluster content strategy

Perfect for content strategists who want actionable SEO insights without leaving WordPress or paying monthly for expensive SaaS tools.

- Topic cluster visualization (interactive graph or tree view of related terms)
- One-click content brief generator — exports structured outlines for writers
- Dashboard widget showing top gaps & quick actions
- Scan scheduling via WP-Cron (weekly/monthly full comparisons)

- Lightweight & performance-optimized (caches results, minimal requests)
